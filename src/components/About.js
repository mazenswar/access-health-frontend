        About Us

      <h3>
        Why we do what we do
      </h3>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response">World Health Organization</a>: </p>

      <p><em>  "Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.</em></p>

      <p><em>  Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote, interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and restoration of mental health can be regarded as a vital concern of individuals, communities and societies throughout the world."</em></p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#part_154787">National Institute of Mental Health</a> states that nearly one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness (46.6 million in 2017).</p>

      <p>What are Mental Health Services?</p>

      <p>In the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2017/NSDUHDetailedTabs2017.htm#tab8-33A">2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)</a> mental health services is defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling, or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health.</p>

      <p>For the purposes of our app, we will be focusing on the services of Psychologists, Therapists, and Psychiatrists.</p>

      <p>Our app facilitates access to mental health services for young professionals (age 18-40) in NYC to whom access to mental health care was previously unavailable by connecting the user with students in the field of mental health treatment.</p>
