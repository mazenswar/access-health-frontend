          Frequently Asked Questions
        </h2>
        <h3>
          What is this service?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Access Health is a service to connect those in need of mental healthcare, yet are unable to access it due to the cost.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Who can use this service?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Currently we are focused on 18-40 year old young working professionals living in NYC.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How much does this service cost me?
        </h3>
        <p>
          None! The professionals listed are all here because they want to help people in need and understand that many of those in need of mental healthcare don't readily have access to it. We also don't charge you anything on our end so it's 100% free!
        </p>
        <h3>
          So how does it work?
        </h3>
        <p>
          First, you should head over to your profile page and fill out the short questionnaire. Don't worry, your data is stored with BlockStack so no one has access to your information (including us). Then head over to the professionals listing page and search for the professional you need. Once you get in contact with them, you should have the option to share your questionnaire information with them. This will help your selected professional tailor to your specific needs.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Which mental healthcare professionals do you provide?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Currently we only offer services from three different mental healthcare professionals: Psychologists, Therapists, and Psychiatrists.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Which mental healthcare professional do I need?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It's hard to say as each case is different, but we do recommend going to a psychologist first. After your initial consultation, your psychologist will either continue to meet with you, or recommend you to seek either a therapist or psychiatrist depending on your specific needs.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What's the difference between those three professionals?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Although it may seem like they all do the same thing, each professional specializes in different aspects of mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Psychologists</strong> earn doctorates in the field of psychology and undergo specialized training to provide mental health treatment. Typically, their graduate studies are within a clinical psychology training program, in counseling psychology, or in developmental psychology. Clinical psychologists provide psychotherapy to clients one-to-one or in a group or family setting. They can also perform detailed batteries of assessments that measure specific mental functions and behaviors. Some of the fields they can specialize in include child, cognitive, clinical, developmental, geriatric, social and community psychology. Because they hold doctoral-level degrees, they are “doctors,” but unlike medical doctors – physicians – they cannot prescribe medications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Therapists</strong> provide interventions such as therapy and counseling. “Talk therapy,” “therapy” and “counseling” are terms that span formal psychotherapy as well as providing guidance for specific issues. Individual, couples, family and group therapy may be performed by many types of mental health practitioners. Therapists and counselors work in hospitals, clinics, schools and universities, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, social service agencies, and in private practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Psychiatrists</strong> are physicians (or doctors) who specialize in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illnesses. Psychiatrists typically work with individuals who have significant mental health problems but many also see a broad spectrum of patients. After medical school, they complete an additional four years or more of residency training in psychiatry. Like other physicians, psychiatrists have the training required to prescribe medications. They are qualified to order and perform a full range of tests that, coupled with discussions with patients, are used to assess an individual’s mental and physical state. They also have the expertise to provide psychotherapy and prescribe other brain treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy. Psychiatrists may direct and supervise other practitioners or conduct research. Areas of specialty include child and adolescent psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, addiction psychiatry and forensic psychiatry.
