# AccessHealth

## Background of the Issue:
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response
):

*"Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.

Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote, interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and restoration of mental health can be regarded as a vital concern of individuals, communities and societies throughout the world."*

According to National early one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness (46.6 million in 2017).

## Design Statement:
An app to provide access to mental health services for young professionals (age 18-40) to whom access to mental health care was previously unavailable (due to financial reasons or lack of coverage).

## MVP:
- An app that facilitates the connection between a User (patient) and a Doctor who specializes in mental health services.
- The User logs in and is directed to a landing page which contains information about the app and a FAQ section. From a Nav bar, the User has the ability to access a list of doctors and the User's profile page. Within the Doctor's list page, the User can search for a doctor by name, filter by specialization/location/language/etc, and select a Doctor to view its page.
